# Read Chapters 2, 3, 4 and then do Exercises 2.2, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3

## Chapter 2

### 2.2. A nonzero integer d is said to divide an integer m if m = dk for some number k.Show that if d divides both m and n, then d also divides m — n and m + n.

### 2.6. If you look at the table of primitive Pythagorean triples in this chapter, you will seemany triples in which c is 2 greater than a. For example, the triples (3,4, 5), (15,8,17),(35,12,37), and (63,16,65) all have this property.

#### (a) Find two more primitive Pythagorean triples (a,b,c) having c = a + 2.

#### (b) Find a primitive Pythagorean triple (a, 6, c) having c = a + 2 and c > 1000.

#### (c) Try to find a formula that describes all primitive Pythagorean triples (a,b,c) having c = a+ 2.

### 2.7. For each primitive Pythagorean triple (a, 6, c) in the table in this chapter, compute thequantity 2c — 2a. Do these values seem to have some special form? Try to prove that yourobservation is true for all primitive Pythagorean triples.

## Chaper 3

### 3.1. As we have just seen, we get every Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) with b even from the formula(a, b, c) = (u2 — v2, 2uv, u2 + v2) by substituting in different integers for u and v. For example, (n, v) = (2,1) gives thesmallest triple (3, 4, 5).

#### (a) If u and v have a common factor, explain why (a,b,c) will not be a primitivePythagorean triple.

#### (b) Find an example of integers u > v > 0 that do not have a common factor, yet thePythagorean triple (u2 — v2, 2uv, u2 + v2) is not primitive.

#### (c) Make a table of the Pythagorean triples that arise when you substitute in all valuesof u and v with 1 < v < u < 10.

#### (d) Using your table from (c), find some simple conditions on u and v that ensure thatthe Pythagorean triple (u2 — v2, 2uv, u2 + v2) is primitive.

#### (e) Prove that your conditions in (d) really work.

### 3.2. 

#### (a) Use the lines through the point (1,1) to describe all the points on the circlex2 + y2 = 2whose coordinates are rational numbers.

#### (b) What goes wrong if you try to apply the same procedure to find all the points on thecircle x2 + y2 = 3 with rational coordinates?

### 3.3. Find a formula for all the points on the hyperbola2 2 iX - 2T = 1 whose coordinates are rational numbers. [Hint. Take the line through the point (—1,0) having rational slope m and find a formula in terms of m for the second point where theline intersects the hyperbola.]
