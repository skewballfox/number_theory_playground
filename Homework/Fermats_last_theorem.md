# Fermat's last theorem

## 1.

### (a) What does Fermat’s Last Theorem claim?

$A^n+B^n=C^n$ has no solution for any n greater than 2

### (b) Where did Fermat “publish” his “Last Theorem”?

Notes in the margin of Theorem Arithmatica
book published by his son

### (c) Why is it called Fermat’s LastTheorem?

Because it is the last remaining theorem of Fermat that up until the events discussed in the video that hadn't been proven or disproven.

### (d) Why did it hold such a fascination for mathematicians?

because mathematicians love a challenge. The problem looks simple, and Fermat said that he had a solution (which was never published)

## 2.  

### (a) Why did the problem appeal to Wiles, even as a child?

because he could understand the problem as a 10 year old, but none of the great mathematicians of the past could solve it.

because it seemed so simple, so he believed it had to have a solution.

### (b) Why did he work on it secretly?

because he wanted to completely focus on the problem, he didn't want to distract himself.

### (c) How long did it take him to solve the problem (roughly speaking)?

7 years

### (d) What analogy does he use to describe the process of solving a mathematical problem?
like trying to put a carpet in a room where the carpet had more size than the room.

### (e) What did he study that helped him solve the problem? (Be specific. “Number theory” is acute answer, but wrong. . . )
iwasawa theory - which he used to analyze elliptic curves
## 3.  

### (a) What kind of curves are critical to the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem?

elliptic curves

### (b) What is the name of the conjecture whose proof was critical to proving Fermat’s Last Theorem?

Taniyama-Shimura conjecture - a bridge between the worlds of elliptic curves and modular forms

### (c) How does Shimura describe his attempts to replicate Taniyama’s approach to solving problems?
he found that it is very difficult to make good mistakes

### (d) What “trick” allowed one to “count” the number of “packets” of these curves?
 Galois Representations of elliptic curves for primes. this makes it to where you only have to prove something for a single prime number

### (e) What 19th-century technique caught the last curves that had “escaped the net”?
he could switch from prime 3 to prime 5 to allow him to use a set of curves he had already proved were modular and then use the information for the last step in proving the theorem

### (f) What adjectives does Wiles use to describe the insight that led him back to his original approach to the proof?
sudden, unexpected, incredible, most important, indescribably beautiful
